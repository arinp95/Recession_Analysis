# Recession_Analysis
A recession is an economic situation that arrives when the circulation of money in the economy is low for two consecutive quarters. When the circulation of money is low, it means people are not spending money in the market. When people donâ€™t spend money, businesses face losses, which results in an economic slowdown and layoffs. Recession depends on various parameters like GDP growth rate, unemployment rate and consumer spending rate. For our project, we would consider only the GDP growth rate as it is the most common way of measuring recession. A year is divided into four quarters and if a country registers a negative growth rate for two consecutive quarters, then the country is said to be in recession. The modules which we will be using in this project are NumPy, Pandas, and matplotlib for data visualisation and analyse our data with the help of graphs that whether that country has ever been in recession or not. If yes, then we will determine the time the period from when the country was in recession to when it ended.
